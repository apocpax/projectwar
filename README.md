projectwar!
My first project the game of war. Fun fact there is no exact time or inventer of the game of war. To play you first select how many players you would like typically from 2-52 and press begin, After that the cards are dealt out to all players and the war begins. Each round begins after pressing attack each player places one card to do battle with the others and the highest card wins taking the loseing cards with them back into the winners deck at the bottom into one player has all 52 cards. Incase of a war where both cards have the same value like a jack vs a jack then those players flip over the next card and the highest card of those wins, this goes on into one player has the highst value card. GO SEAHAWKS!!!
